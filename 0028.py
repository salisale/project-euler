28. Number spiral diagonals

Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

21 22 23 24 25
20  7  8  9 10
19  6  1  2 11
18  5  4  3 12
17 16 15 14 13

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
'''
layerWidth = 1001
limit = layerWidth**2

diff = 2
totalSum = 0

x = 3 # starting at 2nd layer
while x <= limit:
	totalSum += 4*x + diff*6 # diff*(1,2,3)
	x += diff*3+diff+2
	diff = diff+2

print(totalSum+1) # 669171001
